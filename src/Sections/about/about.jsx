                My Journey into tech was as a result of curiosity. Endless waves of questions always popped(still pops) 
                into my mind, questions that led to more confusion as to how these tech things are done. Personally, 
                I believe proficiency is birthed from and in the place of deep confusion on and about a matter because 
                when clarity finally comes; all the roads not to take are already known. And the beautiful thing about 
                all these is that even things that were not set out to be learnt become discovered - this is basically 
                my tech story. I ventured into web development as a teenager, and after a one week period I dumped it, 
                maybe because I was trying to memorize all the HTML tags I came across; sad. Time went on and I realized 
                that I had thrown a gem away and thatâ€™s when I picked it back up,  but this time, as a ui/ux designer and 
                decided that it will be one of the tools I will use to  dig the earth in search of wealth along-side making 
                global impact, touching lives and providing solutions.
